## What is?

Sometimes I get stuck on social media due the beautiful designs and geometry related stuff that shows up in my feed. And I always wanted to implement these kind of works/designs as animations, but I didn't. So this project is to do it: create any kind of interesting animations, whether from the internet or even from my mind. Also, the name is ref to the [aria math](https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/aria-math) by C418!

## Current animations
  
As the time I write this document, the project has two animations

All animations runs 60fps in real devices and the browser, the gifs are just for preview purposes

<br />

### 1. Minimal particle acceleration

Created just to setup the project and write some lines of code

- Linear acceleration
- Without physics

<br />

### 2. Circular particle acceleration

Same as the first one, created just to setup the project and to release criativity

- Linear acceleration
- Without physics
